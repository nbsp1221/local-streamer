## 🎯 **User Flow-Based Roadmap**

### **Primary User Story**: *"I want to watch a playlist continuously like YouTube"*
### **Secondary User Story**: *"I want to manage my playlists easily"*

---

## 🚀 **Phase 2: Primary User Flow Implementation**

### 🎯 Objectives
Transform current "playlist listing" into "continuous viewing" experience

### 📝 Implementation Plan

#### **2.1 Playlist-to-Player Flow**
```
Current: PlaylistCard → (blocked)
Target:  PlaylistCard → First Video Player + Playlist Sidebar
```

**Tasks:**
1. **Update PlaylistCard click behavior**
   - Change from navigation to first video playback
   - Route to `/player/{firstVideoId}?playlist={playlistId}`
   - Handle empty playlists gracefully

2. **Enhance Player with Playlist Context**
   - Detect `playlist` query parameter in `player.$id.tsx`
   - Load playlist data in player page loader
   - Show/hide playlist sidebar based on context

3. **Create PlaylistSidebar Component**
   ```
   app/features/playlist/components/
   └── PlaylistSidebar.tsx      # Right sidebar in player
       ├── Current video highlight
       ├── Next/Previous navigation
       ├── Episode list with thumbnails
       └── Auto-play controls
   ```

4. **Auto-progression Logic**
   - Auto-play next video on completion
   - Keyboard shortcuts (N for next, P for previous)
   - Progress tracking within playlist

#### **2.2 Playlist Management UI**
Add convenient management without disrupting primary flow:

1. **PlaylistCard Enhancement**
   - Add "..." menu button (hover/click)
   - Dropdown options: Edit, Delete, Share
   - Keep primary click for playback

2. **Quick Edit Modal**
   ```
   app/features/playlist/components/
   └── EditPlaylistModal.tsx     # Lightweight editing
       ├── Name/description editing
       ├── Privacy toggle
       └── Delete confirmation
   ```

### ✅ Phase 2 Deliverables
- [ ] Playlist-to-player direct navigation
- [ ] Player with playlist sidebar
- [ ] Auto-progression between videos
- [ ] Playlist management menu on cards
- [ ] Quick edit/delete functionality
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for navigation

**Success Metric:** User can click playlist → immediately start watching → seamlessly continue to next video

2. **Playlist Organization**

- No feature creep without clear user value

### **YouTube-like UX**
- Familiar interaction patterns
- Continuous playback as default expectation
- Minimal cognitive load for basic operations

### **Performance Focused**
- Server-side data loading (React Router v7 loaders)
- Minimal client-side state management
- Fast transitions between videos
